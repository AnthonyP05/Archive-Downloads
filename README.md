# FileAutomation

This is my first public script. I'm still new to developing and thought I'd make this public in case anyone wanted to use it! If you have any questions or comments, please open an issue.

## What does it do?

Once ran, it will go through your downloads folder and archive all of them into your C:\User\%user%\Documents directory in a folder labeled "Archive" in their respective cateogry file type.

## How do I use it?

Download this repository as a zip or through github desktop and run the .exe located in **dist\fileAutomation**

## Is the .exe safe?

Yes the .exe is safe but if you'd prefer to run the file yourself, the file is include at **fileAutomation.py**

## How do I run the file instead of the .exe?

> ## Only available for Windows

> You can download Python directly from the Microsoft Store and once downloaded, you can open your command prompt 
> hitting your windows key and typing **cmd** and hitting enter.
>
> Once opened, head to your downloads folder and unzip or extract the downloaded file. Right-click the unzipped or
> extracted file and click "Copy as Path" and go back to your command prompt and type "cd {paste path here}"
>
> Finally, you can type the command **"python fileAutomation.py"**
